# Operators and Expressions in C#
=====================================
##  Operators
Every programming language uses operators, through which we can perform 
different actions on the data. Let’s take a look at the operators in C# and see 
what they are for and how they are used. 
### What Is an Operator? 
After we have learned how to declare and set a variable in the previous 
chapter, we will discuss how to perform various operations with them. For this 
purpose we will get familiar with operators. 
Operators allow processing of primitive data types and objects. They take as 
an input one or more operands and return some value as a result. Operators 
in C# are special characters (such as **"+", ".", "^"*, etc.) and they perform 
transformations on one, two or three operands. Examples of operators in C# 
are the signs for adding, subtracting, multiplication and division from math 
(+, -, *, /) and the operations they perform on the integers and the real 
numbers. 
### Operators in C# 
Operators in C# can be separated in several different categories: - Arithmetic operators – they are used to perform simple mathematical 
operations. 
- Assignment operators
– allow assigning values to variables.
- Comparison operators
– allow comparison of two literals and/or 
variables.
- Logical operators
– operators that work with Boolean data types and 
Boolean expressions.
- Binary operators 
– used to perform operations on the binary 
representation of numerical data. 
- Type conversion operators 
– allow conversion of data from one type to 
another.
